        <h1>Types of Web Development services offered by Webify</h1> Front-End
        and Back-End Web Development Everything that you see on the website is
        called the front end. Initially the front-end web development is
        conducted. This step involves finalising the type of fonts, icons, and
        images based on your brand voice. The back-end represents a particular
        code that is used to connect the website and the server. Back-end web
        development makes sure that the data flows accurately throughout the
        website and the transactions are up to the mark. Common programming
        languages like Java are utilised for completing this process. It is
        mandatory to have an expert to complete back-end web development as it
        requires coding and IT knowledge. Our Web Development Technologies The
        majority of web pages and web apps on the client-side support
        JavaScript, which is the primary web language. This means that while
        server-side technologies vary, web technologies are primarily based on
        JavaScript (.NET, Java, PHP, Ruby, or even server-side JavaScript
        Node.js). Web Development Process (Infographics)
